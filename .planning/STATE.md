# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-17)

**Core value:** Reported spatial and machine-learning results must be scientifically trustworthy, reproducible, and produced from validated artifacts without hidden data leakage.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Offline Verification Harness

## Current Position

Phase: 1 (Offline Verification Harness) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 3
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-07-17 -- Completed Phase 1 Plan 01 offline tier and fixture contract

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 33%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 7 min
- Total execution time: 0.1 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 1 | 7 min | 7 min |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 7 min
- Trend: Baseline established

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

- [Roadmap]: Exactly 20 v1 requirements are assigned once across 10 fine-grained MVP phases.
- [Roadmap]: Verification fixtures precede contract and scientific refactors; unsafe artifact migrations use the shared manifest/atomic foundation.
- [Roadmap]: Existing notebook, CLI, configuration, output, and public-import surfaces remain stable.
- [Phase 01]: Bare pytest selects offline evidence; only explicit network and full_cohort selections enable sockets. — Fail-closed defaults preserve offline evidence while retaining deliberate external-tier opt-ins.
- [Phase 01]: Scientific fixtures are fresh fixed-seed factories isolated under pytest tmp_path. — Later phases need reproducible adversarial inputs without shared mutation or repository artifact writes.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Full-cohort and network validation remain explicit later evidence tiers; default planning and CI must stay CPU/offline.

## Deferred Items

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| v2 | Package rename/path-bootstrap removal, notebook source redesign, chunked storage, and expanded experiment bundles | Out of v1 scope | Roadmap creation |
